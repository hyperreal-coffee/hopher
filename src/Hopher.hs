{-
A Gopher protocol item/line is defined with tab-delimitated fields. This
abstraction makes it easier to handle said lines. The line itself will look
something like this (where 'F' is a tab):

    1Display stringFselector stringFhostFportFextrastuff<CRLF>

About the fields:
    glType: The first character on each line tells you whether the line/item
        describes a document, directory, or search device. AKA "definition."
    glDisplayString: To be shown to the user for use in selecting this document
        (or directory) for retrieval.
    glSelector: A selector string that the client software mus tsend to the server
        to retrieve the documen t(or directory listing).  The selector string
        should mean nothing to the client software; it should never be modified by
        the client. In practice, the selector string is often a pathname or other
        file selector used by the server to locate the item desired. Also referred
        to as the "magic string."
    glHost: the domain-name of the host that has this document (or directory) and...
    glPort: continuing from glHost, the port at which to connect.
    glGopherPlus: Any extra fields are Gopher+ fields and not a part of the original
        Gopher Protocol specification.
