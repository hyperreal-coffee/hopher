cache and reload the resource.

BOOKMARKS: On any page use `+` to add the current page as a bookmark, you'll
be asked to (optionally) provide a bookmark display string. To view bookmarks
use `ctrl` + `b`. When viewing bookmarks you can delete the selected bookmark
with `d`. Bookmark view works the same as any Gopher menu.

TOR: You can browse Gopherspace using Tor, even visit hidden services like
gopher://bztf2mno3tpwrqop.onion:70/1/ if you just start Waffle with `torsocks`,
for example: `torsocks waffle`.
